# SpRocket Central Project

<p style=text-align:'justify'> <strong>Sprocket Central Pty Ltd </strong> is a long-standing KPMG client whom specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. The marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviours. Using the existing 3 datasets (customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, we would have to recommend <strong>which of these 1,000 new customers should be targeted</strong> to drive the most value for the organization.</p>
<p> We would first wrangle the dataset through assessing and cleaning it. We asscess the data based on quality(i.e, how messy the data is) as well as tidyness(i.e, structure) of the data </p>

### We clean the dataset using three main approach
> <strong>Define :</strong> We clearly define the solution to the data issues found</br>
> <strong>Code :</strong> We implement the solution through coding</br>
> <strong>Test :</strong> We verify the codes effect
<p>In the course of doing this, we would build models for the approach we would want to implement as well as come up with a powerpoint presentations of the approach.</p>
<p> We would proceed to exploring the data in various ways including coming up with <strong>edge cutting statistical conclusions</strong> to buttress our claims.</p>
<p> We would then proceed with coming up with a very <strong>comprehensive dashboard</strong> using any BI tool of once choice.</p>

## Enquiries made includes
> Is the profit generated affected by the various product brands?</br>
> Is The Profit Generated by SpRocket affected by Purchases Related to Gender?</br>
> Does the product line affect the property valuation?</br>
How Does The Interferance of Gender and Brand Of a Product Affect The Profit Generated?</br>
Is The Profit Generated by SpRocket affected To The Past 3 Years Bike Related Purchases?</br>
Does the Product line affect the profit generated?</br>

## Findings Derrived includes;
> Product brands greatly influenced the organizations profits</br>
The mean profits made by the various gender groups was not statistically significant</br>
> Product line had no statistical influence on the property valuation of the product</br>
> The mean profits generated by the various product lines were very different</br>
> The past 3 years of bike related purchase of the customers had no effective influence on the profits generated by the organization</br>

## Conclusions
<p style=text-align:'justify'>Of the 1,000 customers, it would benefit the organization most if it channels its advertizing resources on:</p>
People in their <bold>40's</bold> as they seem more interested in the organizations products</br>
Product brands with the high mean profits such as the WeareA2B.</br>
People in the Financing Services, Marketing and Health Sectors should be prioritized most</br>
The large product sizes.</br>
The Product classes of the medium type should as well be prioritized over others since most customers seem to prioritize this classes of products and also its influence on the overall profit of the organization since it's significant compared to the others.</br>
The </bold>Touring</bold> and <bold>Standard</bold> product lines should be considered most. But a greater priority for the Standardard product lines since more people seem to be interested in these product lines before the Touring type due to its high profit margin which is statistically significant compared to the others.</br>
