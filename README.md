## SpRocket Central Project

<p style=text-align:'justify'> <strong>Sprocket Central Pty Ltd </strong> is a long-standing KPMG client whom specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. The marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviours. Using the existing 3 datasets (customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, we would have to recommend <bold>which of these 1,000 new customers should be targeted</bold> to drive the most value for the organization.</p>
<p> We would first wrangle the dataset through assessing and cleaning it. We asscess the data based on quality(i.e, how messy the data is) as well as tidyness(i.e, structure) of the data </p></br>
We clean the dataset using three main approach:
	> <bold>Define :</bold> We clearly define the solution to the data issues found</br>
	> <bold>Code :</bold> We implement the solution through coding</br>
	> <bold>Test </bold> We verify the codes effect</br>
<p>In the course of doing this, we would build models for the approach we would want to implement as well as come up with a powerpoint presentations of the approach.</p>
<p> We would proceed to exploring the data in various ways including coming up with <bold> edge cutting statistical conclusions </bold> to buttress our claims.</p>
<p> We would then proceed with coming up with a very <strong>comprehensive dashboard</strong> using any BI tool of once choice.</p><br>
