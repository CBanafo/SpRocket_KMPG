Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour.Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, we would have to recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. </p> </br>

<p>In the course of doing this, we would have to build models for the approach we would want to implement as well as come up with a powerpoint presentation of the the approach.</p></br>

<p> We would proceed to exloring the data in various ways including coming up with edge cutting statistical conclusions to buttress our claims.</p> </br>

<p> We would then proceed with coming up with a very comprehensive dashboard using any BI tool of once choice.</p> <br>
